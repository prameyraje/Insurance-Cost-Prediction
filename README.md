# Insurance-Cost-Prediction(Medical)
Problem Statement

Task 1:- Prepare a complete data analysis report on the given data.

Task 2:-
● Prepare the data, identifying and extracting key features (both input and output
parameters) relevant to the problem you will solve.

● Build and train a machine learning model. Here you can evaluate different
algorithms, settings and see which model is best for your scenario.

Task 3:- Create a machine learning model to predict the insurance price charged to the
customer. The charge depends on various features such as age, type of coverage,
amount of coverage needed, gender, body mass index (BMI), region, and other special
factors like smoking to determine what health risks the person possesses.

Dataset Description:
In order to make their profit, insurance companies must collect a higher premium than
the amount which may become due to the insured person. To achieve this, insurance
companies invest a lot of time, effort, and money in creating models that accurately
predict healthcare expenses.

Note: The insurance.csv dataset contains 1338 observations (rows) and 7 features (columns). The
dataset contains 4 numerical features (age, bmi, children and expenses) and 3 nominal features
(sex, smoker and region) that were converted into factors with numerical value designated for each
level.
